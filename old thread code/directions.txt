Directions for executing hw2_ex2

Compiling::

	run the MakeFile using the Unix command "make" within the folder containing
	the program source OR the condensed file can be compiled for the same 
	result**.

	amm179@pluto>> make

	OR

	amm179@pluto>> g++ "hw2_ex2(condensed into one).cpp" -o hw2_ex2

Executing::	

	To execute, the command line arguments are as follows..
	
	amm179@pluto>>./hw2_ex2 #Prod #Con #ofIntsToProducePerProd
	
	In plain english, the first two arguments are the number of producers and
	consumers.  The third argument is the number of integers that each producer
	thread will produce to the FIFO.  So if each producer should produce 10
	integers, put a 10 in that argument.  The program will not allow less than
	10 as an argument.  Also, the program will disallow any more than 10 and 0 prods.
	and cons..

Notes::

	This code will execute properly most of the time.  It has a bug in it where
	sometimes when it is executed the consumers somehow get created ahead of the
	producers(despite the producer creation code being before the consumer creation
	code) and then close themselves.  Before I added the functionality that allows
	the consumers to close themselves it would do something similar except it would
	only create one consumer and hang without ever having created the producers.
	I could not determine what caused it, but because reexecution of the code did
	not produce the effect every time I presumed it was less probable than the 
	correct execution.  So to reiterate, the program is very nearly perfect despite
	this bug.
	
**You can either just compile the file hw2_ex2(condensed into one).cpp or you can
use the "make" command in Unix to compile all of the files into the executable,
hw2_ex2
